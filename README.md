The Animal Zoo Assignment with classes and lists

Animals are arriving from zoos around the world and you must organize then into habitats and give them names and bithdates. You must note the age, sex, species, color, and weight of each animal and calculate a birthday from the information you receive from the originating zoo. (use a function for this called: generateBirthDay) What will you do if the birth season is unknown? Calculate a uniqueID (using a function) and a place in your zoo using an array. Each species must have its own habitat. 

Use fileIO for reading the input file and producing the report. 

Use classes, lists, and dictionaries to organize your zoo.

Information will arrive in the following format with an unknown number of lines.
4 year old female hyena, born in spring, tan color, 70 pounds, from Friguia Park, Tunisia
12 year old male hyena, born in fall, brown color, 150 pounds, from Friguia Park, Tunisia
4 year old male hyena, born in spring, black color, 120 pounds, from Friguia Park, Tunisia
8 year old female hyena, unknown birth season, black and tan striped color, 105 pounds, from Friguia Park, Tunisia

Unique animal ID, animal name, birth date, color, weight, origin
